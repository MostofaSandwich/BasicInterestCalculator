# BasicInterestCalculator

This project was designed to show the importance of frequent deposits on the amount of interest accrued over time.
I'm very happy with the input validation. It was the hardest to figure out, but I cannot find any input that causes the program to crash. This way of validation is something I have already brought into other projects I am working on.
The interest calculations are correct, but I could definitely believe there exists a cleaner/clearer way to represent the equations. This could make the code slightly more readable.
I am also not sure I implemented the get/set methods properly. I have seen instances in C++ where the programmer only uses a get method. The way I have done it here feels more like a Java implementation, but it works.
There are many inline comments throughout the code to illustrate what is being done.
